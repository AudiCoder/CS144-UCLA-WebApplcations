This Project is on an online bidding system similar to eBay (Winter 2014). The project consisted of the following parts:

1) System setup: this part involved setting up virtual, installing and testing the required soft-wares like java, mysql and lucene

2) Data extraction: this part involved using JAVA API for XML Processing (JAXP) to extract bidding data from a given source. 
The data contained product information and user information. This part also included developing sql schema for the destination database and
writing data transformation program to load the extracted information into the destination database.

3) Keyword search support: this part involved deciding on appropriate indexes to create, to support efficient search, creating lucene indexes
to enable keyword search and integration of search based on lucene index with mysql queries.

4) Webservice development: this part involves developing web services over the keyword search and mysql query search developed in the backend.
The webservices were developed using Axis2 and deployed on tomcat.

5) Website development:this part involves developing a website that consumes data from these web services.
I will also integrate google maps to show location of each product. The website developed was made responsive and optimized for use of a mobile device.
